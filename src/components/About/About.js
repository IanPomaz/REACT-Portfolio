<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey there! I'm Ian, a former small-business owner who started my career at 19, remodeling homes. Lately, I've been diving headfirst into the world of web development and coding. With a background rooted in construction precision, problem-solving, and teamwork, I've seamlessly transitioned these skills into the digital sphere. I'm proficient particularly in JavaScript, spanning from front-end to back-end development.</p>
